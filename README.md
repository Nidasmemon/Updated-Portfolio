# Updated-Portfolio

I updated my portfolio using the skills I learned so far. I have links that render information about me, my portfolio with links to all my projects, and links that show my contact information. I used Materialize to create a carousel that displays my projects and portfolio. I used a Parallax effect for the pictures for a better user experience.
